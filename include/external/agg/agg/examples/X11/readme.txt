By default only the examples that do not require extra dependancies are built.
with the following commands:

cd (AGGDIRECTORY)/examples/X11
make clean
make

Some examples (freetype_test, trans_curve1_ft and trans_curve2_ft) require the Freetype Library, and can be built with:

make freetype

There is also an example (gpc_test) that requires the GPC library, build it with:

make gpc

Of course, to build ALL examples run:

make all

Alternatively you can also build the examples one by one, using the example name directly:

make aa_demo
make aa_test
