"Anti-Grain Geometry is designed as a set of loosely coupled "
"algorithms and class templates united with a common idea, "
"so that all the components can be easily combined. Also, "
"the template based design allows you to replace any part of "
"the library without the necessity to modify a single byte in "
"the existing code. "
"AGG is designed keeping in mind extensibility and flexibility. "
"Basically I just wanted to create a toolkit that would allow me "
"(and anyone else) to add new fancy algorithms very easily. "
"AGG does not dictate you any style of its use, you are free to "
"use any part of it. However, AGG is often associated with a tool "
"for rendering images in memory. That is not quite true, but it can "
"be a good starting point in studying. The tutorials describe the "
"use of AGG starting from the low level functionality that deals with "
"frame buffers and pixels. Then you will gradually understand how to "
"abstract different parts of the library and how to use them separately. "
"Remember, the raster picture is often not the only thing you want to "
"obtain, you will probably want to print your graphics with highest "
"possible quality and in this case you can easily combine the \"vectorial\" "
"part of the library with some API like Windows GDI, having a common "
"external interface. If that API can render multi-polygons with non-zero "
"and even-odd filling rules it's all you need to incorporate AGG into "
"your application. For example, Windows API PolyPolygon perfectly fits "
"these needs, except certain advanced things like gradient filling, "
"Gouraud shading, image transformations, and so on. Or, as an alternative, "
"you can use all AGG algorithms producing high resolution pixel images and "
"then to send the result to the printer as a pixel map."
"Below is a typical brief scheme of the AGG rendering pipeline. "
"Please note that any component between the Vertex Source "
"and Screen Output is not mandatory. It all depends on your "
"particular needs. For example, you can use your own rasterizer, "
"based on Windows API. In this case you won't need the AGG rasterizer "
"and renderers. Or, if you need to draw only lines, you can use the "
"AGG outline rasterizer that has certain restrictions but works faster. "
"The number of possibilities is endless. "
"Vertex Source is some object that produces polygons or polylines as "
"a set of consecutive 2D vertices with commands like MoveTo, LineTo. "
"It can be a container or some other object that generates vertices "
"on demand. "
"Coordinate conversion pipeline consists of a number of coordinate "
"converters. It always works with vectorial data (X,Y) represented "
"as floating point numbers (double). For example, it can contain an "
"affine transformer, outline (stroke) generator, some marker "
"generator (like arrowheads/arrowtails), dashed lines generator, "
"and so on. The pipeline can have branches and you also can have "
"any number of different pipelines. You also can write your own "
"converter and include it into the pipeline. "
"Scanline Rasterizer converts vectorial data into a number of "
"horizontal scanlines. The scanlines usually (but not obligatory) "
"carry information about Anti-Aliasing as coverage values. "
"Renderers render scanlines, sorry for the tautology. The simplest "
"example is solid filling. The renderer just adds a color to the "
"scanline and writes the result into the rendering buffer. "
"More complex renderers can produce multi-color result, "
"like gradients, Gouraud shading, image transformations, "
"patterns, and so on. Rendering Buffer is a buffer in memory "
"that will be displayed afterwards. Usually but not obligatory "
"it contains pixels in format that fits your video system. "
"For example, 24 bits B-G-R, 32 bits B-G-R-A, or 15 "
"bits R-G-B-555 for Windows. But in general, there're no "
"restrictions on pixel formats or color space if you write "
"your own low level class that supports that format. "
"Colors in AGG appear only in renderers, that is, when you "
"actually put some data to the rendering buffer. In general, "
"there's no general purpose structure or class like color, "
"instead, AGG always operates with concrete color space. "
"There are plenty of color spaces in the world, like RGB, "
"HSV, CMYK, etc., and all of them have certain restrictions. "
"For example, the RGB color space is just a poor subset of "
"colors that a human eye can recognize. If you look at the full "
"CIE Chromaticity Diagram, you will see that the RGB triangle "
"is just a little part of it. "
"In other words there are plenty of colors in the real world "
"that cannot be reproduced with RGB, CMYK, HSV, etc. Any color "
"space except the one existing in Nature is restrictive. Thus, "
"it was decided not to introduce such an object like color in "
"order not to restrict the possibilities in advance. Instead, "
"there are objects that operate with concrete color spaces. "
"Currently there are agg::rgba and agg::srgba8 that operate "
"with the most popular RGB color space (strictly speaking there's "
"RGB plus Alpha). The RGB color space is used with different "
"pixel formats, like 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA with different "
"order of color components. But the common property of all of "
"them is that they are essentially RGB. Although, AGG doesn't "
"explicitly support any other color spaces, there is at least "
"a potential possibility of adding them. It means that all "
"class and function templates that depend on the color type "
"are parameterized with the ColorT argument. "
"Basically, AGG operates with coordinates of the output device. "
"On your screen there are pixels. But unlike many other libraries "
"and APIs AGG initially supports Subpixel Accuracy. It means "
"that the coordinates are represented as doubles, where fractional "
"values actually take effect. AGG doesn't have an embedded "
"conversion mechanism from world to screen coordinates in order "
"not to restrict your freedom. It's very important where and when "
"you do that conversion, so, different applications can require "
"different approaches. AGG just provides you a transformer of "
"that kind, namely, that can convert your own view port to the "
"device one. And it's your responsibility to include it into "
"the proper place of the pipeline. You can also write your "
"own very simple class that will allow you to operate with "
"millimeters, inches, or any other physical units. "
"Internally, the rasterizers use integer coordinates of the "
"format 24.8 bits, that is, 24 bits for the integer part and 8 "
"bits for the fractional one. In other words, all the internal "
"coordinates are multiplied by 256. If you intend to use AGG in "
"some embedded system that has inefficient floating point "
"processing, you still can use the rasterizers with their "
"integer interfaces. Although, you won't be able to use the "
"floating point coordinate pipelines in this case. ";
