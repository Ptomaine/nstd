\h1 {Introduction}

Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) is a toolkit written completely in 
standard and platform independent C++.
It can be used in many areas of computer programming where 2D
graphics is essential. AGG uses only C++ and standard 
C runtime functions, such as memcpy(), sin(), cos(), sqrt(), etc.
It doesn't even use STL. Thus, AGG can be used in a very large 
number of applications, including embedded systems.

Blah-blah blah-blah blah-blah...

\h2 {Subtible of the Introduction}
Most of the graphic libraries have a single class like "Graphics"
in GDI+, that has hunded or even thousands of functions. This object 
can exist implicitly, like in OpenGL. 

... ... ...

\h2 {The Proposal (Another subtitle)}
I would like to break this ancient as mammoth's manure 
tradition and show you the beauty of stability, lightness,
flexibilty, and freedom. Well, you will have to pay something 
for that. Namely, you will have to pay your attention to 
understand the concepts that can seem not very conventional at the 
beginning. For example, it's not that easy to draw a simple line, 
because a line is rather a complex graphic object in terms of AGG.
The simplest object in AGG is a polygon. Well, it's not quite
right either, but all in good time.

... ... ...

\h2 { Tables}
\h3 { Space separated values tables (ssv_table)}

The rows are separated with the new-line character (LF), the cells in the row 
are separaeted with any number of spaces (whitespace or tab). If you need to 
have a space between words in one cell use a nonbreaking space, \m{~_}.

**An example:**

\as_is
{
\ssv_table[Table 2. Space separated values table; anchor=TAB2]
{
\th{ Line Style  ||  Pipeline || add_path || sort || render || total }
\al{ <               >           >           >       >         >     }
     Straight~_lines 2.819       21.207      73.599  71.813    169.437
     Bezier~_curves  79.656      98.957      62.393  99.161    340.167
     Dashed~_curves  99.332      94.182      39.310  73.310    306.134
}
}

**Appears as:**

\ssv_table[Table 2. Space separated values table; anchor=TAB2]
{
\th{ Line Style  ||  Pipeline || add_path || sort || render || total }
\al{ <               >           >           >       >         >     }
     Straight~_lines 2.819       21.207      73.599  71.813    169.437
     Bezier~_curves  79.656      98.957      62.393  99.161    340.167
     Dashed~_curves  99.332      94.182      39.310  73.310    306.134
}

Here **""\m{\th{...}}""** means **""Table Header""**, 
     **""\m{\al{...}}""** -- **""Alignments of the Columns""**. 
Both of these elements are optional.
The columns of the header must be separated with double vertical bars ==(**\m{||}**)==.
The **""Alignment""** extracts the following characters from the line: 
 ==\m{'<', '>', '|', '-'}==, ignoring all other ones. They mean:
      
 * $$'<'$$ --  ""Left Alignment"" (by default)
 * $$'>'$$ -- ""Right Alignment""
 * $$'|'$$ -- ""Centered""
 * $$'-'$$ -- ""Justified""

Each character corresponds to the respective column.
You can change the alignment in a separate cell in the folowing way:

 * $$<|Cell Content$$ -- ""Left Alignment""
 * $$Cell Content|>$$ -- ""Right Alignment""
 * $$<|Cell Content|>$$ -- ""Centered""
 * $$<-Cell Content->$$ -- ""Justified""

The same rules about the table header and the alignments are applicable 
to the other types of tables (see below).
